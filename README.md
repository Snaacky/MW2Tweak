# MW2Tweak
Removes the 91 FPS cap and adds field of view customization support for the latest Steam version of Modern Warfare 2.

## Requirements
* Python 3.4 (or greater)
* pymem
* win32gui

## Setup
1. Clone the repo to a local directory and `cd` to it.
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Change `mw2tweak.ini` to your desired values.
4. `python mw2tweak.py`

## Warning
MW2Tweak comes as is with no guarantees regarding its standing with VAC. This is technically a cheat and could get you banned if you attempt to use it on any servers (public or private) on the Steam version of MW2. MW2 is no longer maintained by Infinity Ward or Activision on Steam so this tool will most likely not be fingerprinted for VAC but I won't be held responsible if you get banned using it. I have used this online (90 FOV, 333 FPS) and didn't receive a ban, YRMV.
