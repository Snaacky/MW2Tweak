# MW2Tweak
Removes the 91 FPS cap and adds field of view customization support for the latest Steam version of Modern Warfare 2.

## Requirements
* Python 3.4 (or greater)
* pymem
* win32gui

## Setup
1. Clone the repo to a local directory and `cd` to it.
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Change `mw2tweak.ini` to your desired values.
4. `python mw2tweak.py`

## Warning
MW2Tweak comes as is with no guarantees regarding its standing with VAC. This is technically a cheat and could get you banned if you attempt to use it on cheat protected servers, which all servers for the Steam version of MW2 are. However, it is unlikely that this tool will be fingerprinted by VAC because Modern Warfare 2 is no longer actively maintained by Activision on Steam. I have actively used this tool on cheat protected servers successfully with conservative values (90 FOV and 333 FPS) but your results may vary.
